            <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
            <p>Atlanta’s rapid population growth has pushed its transportation system to the breaking point. Traffic congestion costs commuters over 100 hours and $1,500 every year, and most major highways—especially around the I-285 perimeter—experience daily gridlock.
            Despite being the region’s primary public transit system, MARTA has struggled to keep up due to limited coverage, inconsistent service, safety concerns, and negative public perception. Many high-growth counties such as Cobb and Gwinnett lack any MARTA rail service, forcing more residents to rely on single-occupancy vehicles.
            Unless Atlanta expands and modernizes its transit infrastructure, congestion, pollution, and commuter dissatisfaction will continue to worsen.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>Our proposal outlines a multi-phase plan to revitalize and expand MARTA, making it a reliable, safe, and widely accessible alternative to driving.<br>
            Key components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modernizing MARTA’s Existing Infrastructure</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing delays and cancellations through stronger maintenance protocols</li>
                    <li>Improving communication between trains, buses, and the MARTA app</li>
                    <li>Updating stations, escalators, tracks, and rail cars</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Strengthening Safety & Shifting Public Perception</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increasing MARTA Police presence and updated 24/7 surveillance</li>
                    <li>Deep-cleaning and renovating stations</li>
                    <li>Launching marketing efforts to rebrand MARTA as safe, dependable, and appealing to all income groups</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Expanding Rail & Bus Coverage Across Metro Atlanta</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extending MARTA into Cobb, Gwinnett, and northern Fulton</li>
                    <li>Expanding service beyond the I-285 loop</li>
                    <li>Introducing additional routes between existing lines</li>
                    <li>Adding new stations along the Beltline for walkability and community access</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>By implementing our proposal, MARTA can transform into a modern, efficient transit system that meets the needs of Atlanta’s growing population. Expected benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced traffic congestion and commute times</li>
                <li>Lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality</li>
                <li>Increased economic development around new and existing stations</li>
                <li>Enhanced quality of life through greater mobility options</li>
                <li>Stronger regional connectivity across metro Atlanta</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With strategic investments and community support, MARTA can become the backbone of Atlanta’s transportation network, fostering a more sustainable and accessible city for all residents.</p>
